# 350. Intersection of Two Arrays II


## Problem Statement

Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return an array containing their intersection. Each element in the result must appear as many times as it shows in both arrays. The order of elements in the result does not matter.

# Examples:

## Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
Output: [2,2] (Note: [2,2] is also a valid answer)
## Example 2:
Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
Output: [4,9] (Note: [9,4] is also a valid answer)

# Constraints:

1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 1000
0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000

# Follow Up:

What if the given arrays are already sorted? How would you optimize the algorithm?
What if nums1's size is small compared to nums2's size? Which algorithm is better?
What if elements of nums2 are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into memory at once?
