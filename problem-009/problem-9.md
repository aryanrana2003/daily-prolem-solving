### Problem Statement

In the universe Earth C-137, Rick discovered a special form of magnetic force between two balls if they are put in his newly invented basket. Rick has `n` empty baskets, the ith basket is at position[i], Morty has `m` balls and needs to distribute the balls into the baskets such that the minimum magnetic force between any two balls is maximum.

Rick stated that magnetic force between two different balls at positions x and y is |x - y|.

Given the integer array `position` and the integer `m`, return the required force.

**Example 1:**

Input: `position = [1,2,3,4,7], m = 3`  
Output: `3`  
Explanation: Distributing the 3 balls into baskets 1, 4 and 7 will make the magnetic force between ball pairs [3, 3, 6]. The minimum magnetic force is 3. We cannot achieve a larger minimum magnetic force than 3.

**Example 2:**

Input: `position = [5,4,3,2,1,1000000000], m = 2`  
Output: `999999999`  
Explanation: We can use baskets 1 and 1000000000.

**Constraints:**

- `n == position.length`
- `2 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= position[i] <= 10^9`
- All integers in `position` are distinct.
- `2 <= m <= n`


## Problem Statement

The provided code addresses a scenario where `m` balls need to be placed on a number line (`position` vector) such that the minimum distance between any two balls is maximized. The function `maxDistance` aims to determine this maximum distance.

## Approach

The code employs a binary search strategy to find the optimal distance between balls. Here's a breakdown of the steps involved:

1. **Sorting:** The `position` vector is first sorted in ascending order using `sort`. This ensures that balls are placed from left to right on the number line, facilitating efficient distance calculation.

2. **Binary Search:**
   - `low` and `high` variables are initialized to represent the minimum and maximum possible distances, respectively.
     - `low` starts at 1 (minimum distance between any two points on the number line).
     - `high` is calculated as the ceiling of the last element in `position` divided by `m-1` (maximum possible distance to accommodate `m` balls).
   - While `low` is less than or equal to `high`:
     - `mid` is computed as the average of `low` and `high`.
     - The helper function `canplaceball` is called to check if `m` balls can be placed with a minimum distance of `mid`.
       - If `canplaceball` returns `true`:
         - `mid` is a valid solution, so we update `ans` to `mid`.
         - We search for a larger distance by setting `low` to `mid + 1`.
       - Otherwise, `mid` is too large, so we narrow down the search by setting `high` to `mid - 1`.

3. **Helper Function `canplaceball`:**
   - `canplaceball` takes three arguments:
     - `x`: The minimum distance between balls to be checked (potential `mid` value).
     - `position`: The sorted vector representing the number line.
     - `m`: The number of balls to be placed.
   - `canplaceball` iterates through `position` to simulate ball placement:
     - `precballs` (previous ball) is initialized to the first element in `position`.
     - `ballsplaced` (number of balls placed) is initialized to 1.
     - For each element `currpos` (current position) in `position`:
       - If the distance between `currpos` and `precballs` is greater than or equal to `x`:
         - A ball can be placed at `currpos`.
         - `precballs` is updated to `currpos` for the next iteration.
         - `ballsplaced` is incremented.
   - `canplaceball` returns `true` if `ballsplaced` is equal to `m` (all balls can be placed), indicating that `x` is a valid minimum distance. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

4. **Return Value:**
   - The function `maxDistance` returns the value of `ans`, which represents the maximum distance between balls that satisfies the placement condition.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is O(log n), where n is the number of elements in `position`. This is because the binary search iteratively halves the search space until the optimal distance is found.

## Space Complexity

The space complexity is O(1), as the algorithm uses constant additional space for variables like `low`, `high`, `mid`, and temporary variables within `canplaceball`.
