## Introduction

This repository is a collection of coding problems that are solved on a daily basis. The problems cover various topics including algorithms, data structures, dynamic programming, and more.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- Each problem is in its own directory (e.g., `problem-001`).
- Each problem directory contains:
  - `problem.md`: A markdown file with the problem statement.
  - `solution.cpp`: Solution in C++.

## Note on Solutions

The solutions provided are designed to work on the LeetCode platform and may not run correctly in a standard local editor or IDE without modification. This is due to the specific input and output handling expected by LeetCode's online judge.
