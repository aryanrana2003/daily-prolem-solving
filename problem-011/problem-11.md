## Minimum Number of K Consecutive Bit Flips

This problem asks you to find the minimum number of flips (changes from 0 to 1 and vice versa) needed in a binary array to convert it into an array containing only 1s. You are allowed to perform these flips in subarrays of a specific size `k`.

Here's a breakdown of the problem:

* **Input:**
    * `nums`: A binary array containing 0s and 1s.
    * `k`: An integer representing the size of the subarray to be flipped at once.
* **Output:**
    * The minimum number of flips required to make all elements in the array 1. If it's impossible to achieve this, return -1.

**Examples:**

* **Example 1:**
    * `nums = [0, 1, 0], k = 1`
    * Output: 2 (Flip the first element and then the third element)
* **Example 2:**
    * `nums = [1, 1, 0], k = 2`
    * Output: -1 (No combination of flips with subarray size 2 can convert all elements to 1)

**Approach:**

Minimum Number of K Consecutive Bit Flips (Code Explanation)
This document explains the provided C++ code for solving the "Minimum Number of K Consecutive Bit Flips" problem in Markdown format.

Code Breakdown:

Function Definition:

minKBitFlips(vector<int>& nums, int k): This function takes a binary array nums and an integer k (subarray size) as input and returns the minimum number of flips required.
Variable Initialization:

n: Stores the length of the input array nums.
flipped: Tracks the number of currently flipped elements within a window.
res: Counts the total number of k-bit flips performed.
isFlipped: A vector of size n where isFlipped[i] indicates whether the element at index i is part of a flipped subarray (1) or not (0).
Iterating Through the Array:

The loop iterates from i = 0 to n-1.
Handling Window Boundary:

if (i >= k): This condition checks if the current index i has passed the initial window of size k.
flipped ^= isFlipped[i - k]: If inside the window, this line adjusts flipped based on whether the element k positions behind the current one (i - k) was previously flipped. This helps maintain the accurate flipped count within the window.
Checking and Flipping:

if (flipped == nums[i]): This condition checks if the current element (nums[i]) needs flipping based on the current flipped count.
If flipped == 0 and nums[i] == 0, it means the current element should be 1 (needs flipping).
If flipped == 1 and nums[i] == 1, it means the current element should be 0 (needs flipping).
if (i + k > n): This condition checks if there are enough elements remaining to form a complete window of size k starting from the current index. If not, it's impossible to achieve all 1s, so the function returns -1.
isFlipped[i] = 1: Mark the current element as flipped.
flipped ^= 1: Adjust flipped to reflect the new flip.
res++: Increment the total flip count.
Returning the Result:

After iterating through the entire array, the function returns the final res which represents the minimum number of k-bit flips required.
Explanation of Key Points:

The isFlipped vector efficiently keeps track of flipped elements within the window.
The flipped variable provides a space-efficient way to maintain the count of flipped elements for the current window.
The code checks if the current element needs flipping based on the desired state (all 1s) and the current flipped count.
It handles the scenario where the remaining array length is insufficient to form a complete window.
This code utilizes a sliding window approach and bit manipulation to solve the problem efficiently. It avoids unnecessary flips and keeps track of the required modifications within the window, resulting in the minimum number of k-bit flips.


**Complexity:**

* Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the array.
* Space complexity: O(1), as we use constant extra space.

**Note:**

This approach assumes the array can contain only 0s and 1s. If other values are possible, modifications might be needed.
